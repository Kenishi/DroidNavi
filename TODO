List of things that still need done for the DroidNavi.


* Add an About screen in both the PC UI and Android.
	* Include License references in the About
* FIX: Currently there is no heartbeat set up so its not possible to know when connectiosn might drop
	uncleanly. So a heartbeat needs to be added to the protocol to watch for this.
	
* Add Preference to PC UI
* Add a more substantial UI for the PC ver instead of a blank dialog
* Add tabs or some info to Android so user knows to slide to move between screens
* Add QRCode Pairing
* Add dialog to PC UI to show IPs of the computer
* Add PC UI window hiding/minimization
* Add Tray icon for PC UI
* Modify Pairing window to have info on Phone IPs 
* Modify Pairing list to show status of paired connections
