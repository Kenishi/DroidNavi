# Python PyQT UI (deprecated)

This is the source code that was used for the Python PyQT UI.

In version 1.2 I scrapped all of the Python code and moved the UI over to Java using the Standard Widget Toolkit. Working with the Qt library is still my preferred method, but there aren't any good wrappers for it on Java that are up-to-date; so this is why I used SWT instead of trying Jambi.
